// This file is made up following this configuration (ITCSS):

// Settings: Global configurations such as colors and fonts
// Tools: Mixins and functions
// Generic: Resets and normalizing styles
// HTML elements: Styles for HTML tags
// Objects: Objects with no visuals -> This is the first layer which uses class selectors (OOCSS, so blueprints for common things)
// Components: Well designed components (specific stuff)
// Trumps: Overrides such as '.hidden'

// Media queries should go with the component they affect, and not just in one layer.
